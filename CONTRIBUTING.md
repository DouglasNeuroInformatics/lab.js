# Contributing

**Thank you for your interest in contributing to `lab.js`! You are more than welcome to join** â€” whether you have new ideas, suggestions, or would just like to muck in, please be warmly invited to do so: This is an open project -- We'd be glad to hear from you, to discuss ideas and approaches, and to get you going. Thank you for taking the time!

Together, **we're building a tool to help scientists understand behavior and cognition in its many forms, and to conduct their research efficiently and transparently**.

As for details, do reach out to us; there's much more information in the [contribution section](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/meta/contribute/index.html) of the project documentation. There, you'll find pointers to different ways of contributing (*spoiler*: writing code isn't the only one), how to find your way around the repository, and how to find us so that we can help you get started. **Welcome to our community!**
