# Project license

All parts of this project are openly available, subject to different licenses:

* The `lab.js` **core library** that is included in your studies is made
  available under the terms of the [Apache License](/packages/library/license).
* The **builder**, the graphical interface used to build experiments,
  is provided under the terms of the [GNU Affero General Public
  License](/packages/builder/license).

Please review the license files linked above for a detailed, legal definition
of their terms.

The studies you build based on the library, and those you create using the
builder, are always your own, and you are free to distribute them as you see
fit. When studies include the core library files, these files alone are governed
by the aforementioned license.
