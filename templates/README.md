# Templates

**This is our collection of templates for frequently used study parts — they're here for you to use and extend.** We're super-thankful to all colleagues and members of the community who have contributed these — if you use a study, please consider sending a note of thanks to whoever put it together.

**All of these examples are available within the builder interface when you add a new component.** You're also welcome to download these files and modify them in the `lab.js` builder.

**If you have study parts that you use frequently, we'd love to add them to the collection, and would like to warmly invite you to contribute! We'd be more than happy to help you.** Likewise, if there's something to improve, please do let us know. We also accept suggestions for new templates, though we'd ask you to outline in detail what you're looking for.
