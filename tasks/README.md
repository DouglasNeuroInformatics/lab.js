# Examples

**This is our collection of examples — they're here for you to use and extend.** We're super-thankful to all colleagues and members of the community who have contributed studies — if you use a study, please consider sending a note of thanks to whoever put it together.

**All of these examples are available within the builder interface when you create a new study.** You can, however, also download these files and run and modify them in the `lab.js` builder.

**If there's a study you'd like to see as an example, please be very warmly invited to contribute!** We'd be more than happy to help you, and building an example is a great way to learn our software. Likewise, if there's something to improve, please do let us know. We also accept suggestions for new studies, though we'd ask you to outline in detail the study you'd like to see, so that it's easier to build (and we might ask you to contribute instructions or stimuli).
